# Previously, this file had a series of                        #
#     from .alts import *                                      #
#     from .award import *                                     #
#     from .badges import *                                    #
# and so on in that fashion. That means that anywhere that     #
#     from files.classes import *                              #
# (and there were a lot of places like that) got anything      #
# was imported for any model imported. So if you, for example, #
# removed                                                      #
#     from secrets import token_hex                            #
# from files/classes/user.py, the registration page would      #
# break because files/routes/login.py did                      #
#     from files.classes import *                              #
# in order to get the token_hex function rather than           #
# importing it with something like                             #
#     from secrets import token_hex                            #
#                                                              #
# Anyway, not fixing that right now, but in order to           #
# what needed to be imported here such that                    #
#     from files.classes import *                              #
# still imported the same stuff as before I ran the following: #
#     $ find files/classes -type f -name '*.py' \              #
#         -exec grep import '{}' ';' \                         #
#         | grep 'import' \                                    #
#         | grep -v 'from [.]\|__init__\|from files.classes' \ #
#         | sed 's/^[^:]*://g' \                               #
#         | sort \                                             #
#         | uniq                                               #
# and then reordered the list such that import * did not stomp #
# over stuff that had been explicitly imported.                #
